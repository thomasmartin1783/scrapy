"Now many nights my breath on your shoulder",
"I am alive in your love",
"Hands when touched",
"Your head on my old chest",
"I'm talking about how intoxicated",
"Now many nights my sigh on your shoulder",
"Why that unabashedly blind song",
"Suzy speaks straight to the beat of the fan blade",
"I could not think",
"You're cracking inside my chest",
"The seeds of your love throughout the body",
"I couldn't stop",
"Soft cheeks on your cheeks",
"Please wipe with my hands ..",
"The melody of your song",
"My pockets are full of lies",
"I left it at your speed",
"I know the argument is far away",
"But you hold me",
"Birch tila tila tila inside me",
